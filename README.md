# Sparkathon

Theme: Supply Chain Management

Phase 1: Smart Substitution Engine + Product Catalog

Primary aim: functional backend + basic UI for:

- Product Inventory management per store
- Allow Placing Order
- Suggests alternatives if out of stock
- Prepares data for delivery optimization (Phase 2)
- Sets foundation for demand tracking (Phase 3): High availability zones

#### Using: MongoDB Atlas

#### Installation: express, mongoose, cors, dotenv, axios

#### Api endpoint testing: Thunder Client (Extension in VS Code)

Phase 1 Steps:

1. Backend Setup with schema creation (products, stores, orders)
2. Data Seeding: DummyJSON API tp fetch 30 products
   - Assign random: quantity, storeID, tags, demandScore(useful for phase 3)
   - Generated 5 fake Walmart stores in India
   - Insert in MongoDB
3. Backend APIs:
   - GET /products - List all products
   - GET /products/:id - product details
   - GET /suggest/:id - substitution engine
   - POST /order/place - place order if in stock
4. Frontend Setup
   - Basic React app using vite bundler
5. Backend Frontend Integration

#### Schema:

1. Store:

   name(String)

   city(String)

   address(String)

   pincode(String)

   latitude(Number)

   longitude(Number)

2. Product:

   #### Generated by DummyJSON API:

   title(String)

   category(String)

   brand(String)

   price(Number)

   image(String)

   description(String)

   #### Added Custom Randomly:

   storeID

   quantity

   tags

   demandScore

   sold

Phase 2: Delivery Routing

Primary aim: functional backend + basic delivery app for agents:

- Map view: Show: start(store location), end(Costumer location), Path, duration and distance
- Shortest Path
- Future: dynamic routing(due to traffic etc.)
  1.  Single delivery
  2.  Multiple deliveries on go and new order placed (if possible)

#### Using: OpenStreetMap + Leaflet.js (Free & Open Source), Browser Geolocation API (for live location tracking), Web Speech API (speechSynthesis)

#### OpenRouteService or OSRM for route directions

#### Add new api endpoints in backend for deliveries and routes

#### Installation: react-router-dom, leaflet react-leaflet

#### Api endpoint testing: Thunder Client

Phase 2 Steps:

1. Basic React (Vite) frontend
2. Routing using OpenRouteService
   - Link Real Order Data to Route
   - Calculate and Display ETA(Expected Time of Arrival)
   - Display Turn-by-Turn Instructions

API Endpoint:

- GET /order/:orderId
- To get all deliveries: GET /
- POST /place

3. Delivery Agent Live location
4. Delivery Instruction text to speech
5. Mark as Delivered button, UI updation and status change
   API Endpoint:
   - Patch /order/:id/delivered

Dynamic Routing(On Hold)

### Phase 3: HeatMap (“AutoZone Restocker”)

#### Aim -> city‑level demand vs stock heat‑map

#### Using: For visualisation: react-leaflet, leaflet.heat, react-chartjs-2, chart.js

New Route: routes/analytics.js

- aggregate products by store's city and sum their demandScore
- Proper dashboard with heatmap, top products sold bar chart and a pie of major locations order placed
